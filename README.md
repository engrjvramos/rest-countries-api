### Continued development

I would like to add some extra features to this project in the near future. The following items below are some of my ideas that would make the project better!

1. Add a SORT DROPDOWN MENU to sort countries by population (highest to lowest), total area (highest to lowest) and name (A to Z).
2. Add a LIVE MAP to show the location of each country.
3. Add BORDER COUNTRIES and click through to show its details.
